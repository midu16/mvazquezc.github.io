      <description>Enhanced Version and Build Information for your Go programs with ldflags In the previous post we show how to create a simple CLI in Go with Cobra. I received a suggestion from one of my colleagues, Andrew Block. He suggested complementing that post with the use of ldflags at build time in order to define specific information to a specific build like build time, git commit, etc.
Andy is also running a blog, go check it out!</description>

      <description>Writing CLIs in Go using Cobra A few months ago, I was working with my colleague Alberto in a CLI. The language of choice was Go and I manage to learn a thing or two. In today&amp;rsquo;s post we will see a very basic skeleton for a CLI written in Go. This will certainly help me in the future as a template for the next CLI, and maybe it helps you too!</description>
